## Accountant Ledge

------
## <ins>My Plan:

**Three classes** -> transactions, transactionManager, financialTracker

transaction 
=
> - Represent a transaction
> - which holds - (Date, time, description, vendor, amount)

transactionManager
= 
> - Reads and writes transactions to/from teh CSV file; filters transactions (deposits, payments, etc.)

financialTracker 
=
> - Main application (handles the menu and user interaction).
